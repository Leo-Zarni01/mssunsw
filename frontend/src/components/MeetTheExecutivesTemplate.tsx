    memory: "Being a part of the Myanmar Students' Society (MSS) has been one of the most memorable experiences of my university life at UNSW. From planning cultural events like Thingyan, Da Saung Taing, and Thadingyut  to collaborating with other societies and helping communities back home, each moment has been filled with pride and purpose. MSS has helped me stay connected to my roots while giving me the opportunity to celebrate and share our culture with the wider community. The friendships and memories I’ve made here will always hold a special place in my heart.",

We were drenched in our traditional clothes, but instead of letting it ruin the day, we laughed, helped each other, and embraced the chaos. Despite everything, the festival spirit stayed strong, making it a truly memorable celebration!",

It was like a comforting, warm embrace, especially after not hearing or speaking Burmese for so long—it felt like reconnecting with a part of me I’d missed.",

    memory: "Being a part of MSS has allowed me to connect with my Burmese culture and find a community that makes me feel like I’m not so far away from home. As someone who has always felt a bit alienated from my Burmese heritage, I will never forget how welcome I felt at my first couple MSS events. I was driven to create the same feeling of belonging for other Burmese students who desired to feel more connected to their Burmese culture. My favourite memories during my time in MSS have definitely been the ones that have come from working within my team, such as the chaos of cooking food for events and organising Thingyan.",

Being away from home can be tough, but this society has made me feel at home again. The people here are kind and warm-hearted, and I will truly miss all the events with MSS.",
